Architecture deep dive part 1 - Explaining differencies between monolith and tieed architecture. Tiered architecture is better solution were we have coupled tier's then in Monolith infrastructure where storage, load and processing depends on each other. In tiered architectire there was used example with ALB to scale the processing part. In that example we have HA for processing part. If one of the instances fails laod balancer moves processing to another instances which is healthy.
